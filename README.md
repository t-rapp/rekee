Rekee
=====

Rekee is an editor that allows designing of custom tracks for the boardgames
[Rallyman: GT] and [Rallyman: DIRT] published by Holy Grail Games. This software
is a personal project with the goal to build a cross-platform web application as
an alternative to the currently existing [Rallyman Track Editor][track editor],
which is Windows-only.
