Vic Fieger License

The Vic Fieger fonts are freeware, to be downloaded and used by anyone who
wants them for free. I didn’t put them here so people couldn’t use them! You
don’t have to ask for my permission, though it’s always good to receive an
e-mail from somebody to show me what they are using them for.

If you wish to write to let me know how a certain font will be used, and for
what purpose, send your e-mail to: vic@vicfieger.com
