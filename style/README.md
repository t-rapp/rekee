Rekee Style
===========

Rekee uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework. This folder contains
the settings that have been used to generate the file in `www/bulma.min.css`.

To initialize the folder after checkout use:
```
npm ci
```

After changes to `bulma.scss`, generate the CSS output file with:
```
npm run build
```

See <https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/> for more
information.
